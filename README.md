### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Abdiraxman Bade. Welcome to my Github profile.

I'm a thriving engineering student who has a passion for all things hardware related. Whether that would be computer hardware installation, logic designing, manipulating microcontrollers using code, or just building electric circuits, working with hardware is an experience I wish to learn in my future career. 

Feel free to contact me as I am constantly eager to interact with new people and push myself to pursue new possibilities!
